Onboarding Components:
- WelcomeComponent: Introduction with 4 feature highlights
- SelectTopicsComponent: Grid-based topic selector with Min/Max validation
  - Selected topics tracked in Set<string>
  - Real-time validation messages
  - Complete onboarding flow (saves to Firestore, navigates to /tabs)

Code Quality:

4. Observable-based loading/error states for smooth UX
5. Topic categories with icons and colors for visual differentiation

Architecture:
- Topic service manages all Firestore topic operations
- SelectTopicsComponent handles selection logic and validation
- Onboarding module lazy-loads both components
- Navigation guard will prevent direct access (Phase 4)

## Key Learnings & Discoveries

### Lessons from Previous Implementation
1. **Error -201 Root Cause**: Importing Capacitor plugins at module level causes early initialization
   - **Solution**: Use dynamic imports with `await import()`
   - **Applied in**: Phase 8 (Notifications)

2. **Platform Detection**: Must check Capacitor platform before any native calls
   - **Pattern**: `if (this.platform.is('capacitor')) { ... }`
   - **Applied in**: All services

3. **Firebase Emulator**: Android requires 10.0.2.2, iOS/web use localhost
   - **Applied in**: Phase 1 (Firebase setup)

4. **Module-Level Calls**: Avoid executing code at module evaluation time
   - **Solution**: Use function-based providers in Angular modules
   - **Applied in**: Phase 1 (app.module.ts)

### Best Practices Established
- Use dynamic imports for ALL Capacitor plugins
- Always check platform before plugin calls
- Unit test all services before moving forward
- Validate on all platforms (web, iOS, Android)
- Test on device/simulator (not just browser)
